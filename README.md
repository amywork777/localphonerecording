# TaiRecorder - Flic Button Voice Recorder

A React Native/Expo app that connects to a Flic button via Bluetooth for hands-free audio recording. Perfect for capturing voice memos, interviews, or any audio content with simple button presses.

## üéØ Features

- **Bluetooth LE Connection**: Pairs with Flic smart buttons
- **Background Recording**: Continues recording when phone is locked
- **Smart Button Actions**:
  - Single click: Start recording / Add bookmark
  - Double click: Stop and save recording
  - Hold (1s+): Stop and flag as important
- **Upload Queue**: Automatic file management with retry logic
- **Kill Switch**: Disable button responses when needed
- **Notifications**: Visual feedback for all actions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Flic button (any generation)
- iOS device or Android device for testing

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone <your-repo>
cd TaiRecorder
npm install

# Start development server
npm run web          # Web preview (limited BLE support)
npm run ios          # iOS simulator/device
npm run android      # Android simulator/device
```

### First Time Setup

1. **Grant Permissions**: The app will request microphone and Bluetooth permissions
2. **Pair Flic Button**: 
   - Tap "Pair Flic Button" on the home screen
   - Follow the pairing instructions
   - Press and hold your Flic button until it blinks
3. **Test Recording**: Try single/double click to ensure everything works

## üì± Usage

### Button Actions
- **Single Click**: 
  - If idle: Start recording
  - If recording: Add bookmark at current time
- **Double Click**: Stop recording and save to upload queue
- **Hold (1+ second)**: Stop recording and flag as important

### Manual Controls
- **Kill Switch**: Temporarily disable button responses
- **Manual Start/Stop**: Backup controls via the UI
- **Upload Status**: View and manage upload queue

### Background Operation
The app works when your phone is locked thanks to:
- iOS: Audio background mode keeps recording active
- Android: Foreground service maintains connection
- Auto-reconnect: Flic button reconnects automatically

  maxRetries: 5,
  retryDelay: 2000,
  cleanupAfterDays: 7,
};
```

### Bundle Identifiers
Update `app.json` with your own bundle IDs:

```json
"ios": {
  "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.tairecorder"

"android": {
  "package": "com.yourcompany.tairecorder"
}
```

## üì± Building for Production

### iOS (TestFlight)
